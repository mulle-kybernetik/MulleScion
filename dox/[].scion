Within **MulleScion** you can use regular Objective-C method call syntax.

#### Example 1
````
{{ [NSDate date] }}
````

But you can also use '[' ']' in the "modern" way, to access dictonaries and
array. So if you don't want to write `objectAtIndex:` or `objectForKey:` you
can also use:

#### Example 2
````
{{ bag[ "a" ] }}  # where bag is a NSDictionary
{{ list[ 1] }}    # where list is a NSArray
````

<cite>See [properties.plist](properties.plist) for the values used in this example.</cite>
