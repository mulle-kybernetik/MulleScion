Pipes convert the left side to a string and then apply the right side to the
string. The right side can be any method callable on NSString. But it can't have
any parameters. Pipes have lower precedence than the [`includes`](/dot.scion?wrapper=_wrapper.scion) operator.

#### Example 1
```
{{ @"A STRING" | lowercaseString | uppercaseString }}
```
